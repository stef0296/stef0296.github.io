                        An Android based application which can be used by parents to track their children’s whereabouts. 
                        It is a revolutionary safety tracking application that uses waypoints similar to the ones used in autopilot systems in flights.
                        The application passively tracks the user location and sends a notification to trusted contacts when the user enters the area of the predefined waypoint.
                        The application solves the technological issues faced in developing countries such as lack of internet access to maintain contact between users of the application even when offline.

                        An intelligent lighting system which switches the colors of LED lights based on the constant frequency change of any music file.
                        This is a server based application consists of a central controller, accessible via a web application which receives the music as an audio input, samples the audio file and gives an output which controls the lighting system accordingly.
                        Lighting system makes use of solid state relays for fast switching of lights.
                        It is an IOT based project built on a Raspberry PI and coded in Python.
